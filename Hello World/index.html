  <h1> Soccer</h1>
  <p1> My most favorite hobbies is the beautiful game of soccer,
    I played soccer for 5 years on a team back in Vermont, where
    I was a captain of the team for 4 years. In Vermont that was
    the one thing that me and my friends always did, we used to
    play soccer until the sun went down, and sometimes even after
    that, with glow in the dark soccer balls.

  <h2> Video Games</h2>
  <p2> Another big hobby of mine is playing video games, I play
    casually with my friends. We mainly play Fortnite right now,
    a game that became massively popular throughout the world.
    I also used to be a big fan of Wizard 101 when I was younger
    it's a big MMO game focused on Wizards. I've also played and
    sometimes still play Minecraft a lot. It has began to regain
    it's popularity and me and my friends play it sometimes as well.
